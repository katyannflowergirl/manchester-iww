			<h3>Why join the IWW?</h3>

			<p>The Industrial Workers of the World is a revolutionary global union,
				fighting for better conditions today and economic democracy tomorrow.
				We are a grass roots, democratic union, ran directly by the rank and
				file members, not union bureaucrats. We don't sell insurance or credit
				cards. But we're fighting and winning.
			</p>

			<p>
				We teach all our members powerful organising tools, basic labour law,
				direct democracy and the creative direct action methods which give power
				back to the workers. If you're interested in attending a training
				session, get in <a href="mailto:manchester@iww.org.uk">touch</a>!
			</p>

			<p>
				We rely on each other, on the solidarity of our movement. Our members
				&ndash; from cleaners to teachers, shop and bar staff to call centre workers,
				factory workers to carers to more &ndash; are putting fear aside to take
				action other unions say is impossible.
			</p>

			<p>
				But we want more. We want the economy run for the benefit of everybody,
				not a handful of executives on unimaginable pay.  For this to happen, we
				need to be united into one movement, one big union, in every section of
				the economy.  For this reason, we encourage existing union members,
				students and unemployed workers to also join the IWW, chipping in skills,
				time and experience to support other struggles and coming together across
				our industries regardless of other union divisions.
