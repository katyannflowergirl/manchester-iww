			<h3>Am I entitled to a break?</h3>
			<p>
				Don't hold your breath! Under the Working Time Regulations, you are entitled
				to a 20 minute break if the working day / shift is more than 6 hours. So you
				could be expected to work a 6 hour shift with no break. Behind a bar, you'll
				probably be dead on your feet at that stage. And, what's more, the break does
				not even have to be paid! This doesn't mean that you can't negotiate something
				better, so see<!--Make this a link?--> "What will joining a union do to help?" below.

			<h3>Should I be bought a taxi home?</h3>

			<p>
				You don't have any legal right to a taxi to and from work, though a responsible
				employer would want his or her employees to be able to travel home safely after
				a late shift.
			</p>

			<h3>What is the minimum wage?</h3>

			<p>
				The national minimum wage is currently &pound;6.50 per hour in 2014/2015 for
				those 21 and over, and &pound;5.13 for 18 to 20 year olds. Any service charges,
				tips, gratuities and cover charges you are paid must be on top of your
				minimum wage rate. This applies no matter where you work. This regularly
				changes, so check <a
					href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">here</a> for any
				changes.
			</p>

			<h3>Is it legal to close late at night and open in the morning?</h3>

			<p>
				Yes, it is. However, you should not be asked to work both an evening shift and
				a morning shift with less than 11 hours' rest in between. Additionally, you are
				entitled to a weekly continuous rest break of 24 hours.
			</p>

			<h3>Can I be told to go home mid-shift if it's quiet?</h3>

			<p>
				If you are employed for a shift, then you should be paid your wage in full for
				that shift. So, if they send you home, you should still be paid.
			</p>

			<h3>What are my rights if I feel threatened by customers?</h3>

			<p>
				Your employer has a duty of care towards you to provide a safe system of
				work and a suitable working environment. If you feel threatened by customers
				you should tell your manager, make a written record of your conversation and
				contact your union rep for further advice.
			</p>

			<h3>Am I entitled to sick pay / maternity leave / annual leave?</h3>

			<p>
				Every woman has the right to Maternity Leave, though not necessarily paid;
				Every employee has the right to 5.6 weeks' paid holiday a year (equivalent
				to 28 days for someone who is employed full-time); However, you are only
				entitled to sick pay if you fulfil the qualifying conditions for Statutory
				Sick Pay (SSP), and then only once you have been ill for 4 days in a row.
			</p>

			<h3>What will joining a union do to help?</h3>

			<p>
				As you can see, you have few legal rights as an employee. However, as a union
				member you can join together with your fellow workers to get a better
				deal at work. Your union can help you with support and information, and
				give you and your fellow workers the training and confidence to
				negotiate better terms and conditions with your employer. All workers
				have a right to join a union, and the IWW is dedicated to building a
				democratic union that fights for all workers. Get in contact with us <a
					href="mailto:manchester@iww.org.uk">here</a> and join the union <a
